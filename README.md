           Python 3.x.x
      3. Verify pip Installation:
        - Type pip --version to ensure pip is installed. pip is Python's package installer.
           C:\> pip --version
           pip 21.x.x from C:\Python39\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.9)
     Step 4: Set Up a Virtual Environment
      A virtual environment helps you manage dependencies for different projects by isolating them from the global Python installation.
       1. Navigate to Your Project Directory:
        - Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment.
           C:\> cd path\to\your\project
       2. Create the Virtual Environment:
        - Use the 'venv' module to create a virtual environment.
           C:\path\to\your\project> python -m venv myenv
        - Replace 'myenv' with your desired environment name.
       3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
        - Navigate to the Scripts directory inside your virtual environment folder.
           C:\path\to\your\project> myenv\Scripts\activate
        - Once activated, you should see '(myenv)' at the beginning of the command prompt line, indicating that the virtual environment is active.
           (myenv) C:\path\to\your\project>
       4. Install Packages:
        - Use 'pip' to install packages inside the virtual environment.
           (myenv) C:\path\to\your\project> pip install package_name
       5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment:
        - To exit the virtual environment, simply type:
           (myenv)   C:\path\to\your\project> deactivate

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
      `print("Hello, World!")`
       1. `print` Function
         - Function: In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
         - 'print' Function: The 'print' function outputs text or other data to the console. It is one of the most commonly used functions in Python for displaying information.
       2. Parentheses `()`
         - Parentheses: Functions in Python are called using parentheses. The print function is no exception; the parentheses are used to enclose the arguments that are passed to the function.
       3. String
         - String: A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. In Python, you can use either single (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) to denote a string.
         - `"Hello, World!"`: In this example, "Hello, World!" is a string argument passed to the print function. The quotes are necessary to tell Python that it is a string literal.
       4. Double Quotes `""`
         - Double Quotes: Double quotes are used here to enclose the string `"Hello, World!"`. Python supports both single and double quotes for strings, so you could also write `'Hello, World!'`.
       5. Statement
         - Statement: In Python, a statement is a line of code that performs an action. The entire line `print("Hello, World!")` is a statement that tells Python to print the string to the console.
       6. Execution Flow
         - Execution: When you run the Python program, the interpreter reads and executes the code line by line from top to bottom. Since this program consists of a single line, it directly prints `"Hello, World!"` to the console.
       Complete Code Explanation
         - The program is a single-line Python script.
         - The `print`function is called with a string argument `"Hello, World!"`.
         - When executed, the `print` function sends the string to the console, which displays the text.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
     Basic Data Types in Python
      1. Integers (`int`)
         - Description: Whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.
         - Example: `42`, `-7`
      2. Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)
         - Description: Numbers that have a decimal point. 
         - Example: `3.14`, `-0.001`
      3. Strings (`str`)
         - Description: A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (single or double).
         - Example: `"Hello, World!"`, `'Python'`
      4. Booleans (`bool`)
         - Description: Represents one of two values: `True` or `False`.
         - Example: `True`, `False`
      5. Lists (`list`)
         - Description: Ordered, mutable collections of items, enclosed in square brackets.
         - Example: `[1, 2, 3]`, `['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']`
      6. Tuples (`tuple`)
         - Description: Ordered, immutable collections of items, enclosed in parentheses.
         - Example: `(1, 2, 3)`, `('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')`
      7. Dictionaries (dict)
         - Description: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces.
         - Example: `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}`
      8. Sets (`set`)
         - Description: Unordered collections of unique items, enclosed in curly braces.
         - Example: `{1, 2, 3}, {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}`
      9. None Type (`NoneType`)
         - Description: Represents the absence of a value or a null value.
         - Example: `None`
     Short Script Demonstrating Basic Data Types
      Here’s a Python script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types:
       # Integers
        age = 25
        print(f'Integer: {age} (Type: {type(age)})')
       # Floating-Point Numbers
       pi = 3.14159
       print(f'Float: {pi} (Type: {type(pi)})')
       # Strings
       greeting = "Hello, World!"
       print(f'String: {greeting} (Type: {type(greeting)})')
       # Booleans
       is_sunny = True
       print(f'Boolean: {is_sunny} (Type: {type(is_sunny)})')
       # Lists
       fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
       print(f'List: {fruits} (Type: {type(fruits)})')
       # Tuples
       dimensions = (1920, 1080)
       print(f'Tuple: {dimensions} (Type: {type(dimensions)})')
       # Dictionaries
       person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
       print(f'Dictionary: {person} (Type: {type(person)})')
       # Sets
       unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
       print(f'Set: {unique_numbers} (Type: {type(unique_numbers)})')
       # None Type
       no_value = None
       print(f'None: {no_value} (Type: {type(no_value)})')


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
     Conditional statements allow you to execute code blocks based on certain conditions. The basic syntax involves the `if` statement, and optionally, `elif` (else if) and `else` statements for additional conditions.
      Example:
       Let's determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero. 
        number = 10
        if number > 0:
        print("The number is positive.")
        elif number < 0:
        print("The number is negative.")
        else:
        print("The number is zero.")
       The number is positive.
       `for` Loop
         A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) and executes a block of code for each element.
       Example:
        Iterate through a list of numbers and print each one.
         numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
         for number in numbers:
         print(number)
       Output:
         1
         2
         3
         4
         5

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
     Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They allow you to encapsulate functionality and promote code reuse, making your programs more modular and easier to maintain.
      Key Characteristics of Functions:
       1. Reusability: Functions can be called multiple times within a program, reducing code duplication.
       2. Modularity: They help in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable chunks.
       3. Readability: Functions can make code more readable by giving a name to a set of operations.
       4. Maintainability: Changes in functionality need to be made in only one place.
      Syntax:
       def function_name(parameters):
         # code block
         return result
       - function_name: The name of the function.
       - parameters: Inputs to the function.
       - return: Specifies the output of the function
      Example: Sum Function
       def add_two_numbers(a, b):
        """Return the sum of two numbers."""
        return a + b
        result = add_two_numbers(5, 7)
        print(result)
        Output:
        12

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
     Differences Between Lists and Dictionaries in Python
      Lists:
       - Ordered: Lists maintain the order of items as they are inserted.
       - Indexed: Elements are accessed by their position (index), starting from 0.
       - Mutable: Items in a list can be changed, added, or removed.
       - Homogeneous or Heterogeneous: Can store elements of the same type or different types.
       - Syntax: Defined using square brackets [] 
      Dictionaries:
       -  Unordered: Items do not have a specific order.
       - Key-Value Pairs: Elements are accessed via unique keys.
       - Mutable: Key-value pairs can be added, changed, or removed.
       - Heterogeneous: Keys and values can be of different types.
       - Syntax: Defined using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by a colon `:`.
      Basic Operations on Lists and Dictionaries
       # Creating a list of numbers
       numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
       # Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
       info = {
       "name": "John",
       "age": 25,
       "city": "San Francisco"
      }
       # Operations on the list
       print("Original list:", numbers)
       # Accessing an element by index
       second_element = numbers[1]
       print("Second element:", second_element)
       # Adding an element
       numbers.append(60)
       print("List after adding an element:", numbers)
       # Removing an element
       numbers.remove(20)
       print("List after removing an element:", numbers)
       # Slicing the list
       sublist = numbers[1:3]
       print("Sliced sublist:", sublist)
       # Operations on the dictionary
       print("\nOriginal dictionary:", info)
       # Accessing a value by key
       name = info["name"]
       print("Value of 'name' key:", name)
       # Adding a key-value pair
       info["email"] = "john@example.com"
       print("Dictionary after adding a key-value pair:", info)
       # Updating a value
       info["age"] = 26
       print("Dictionary after updating a value:", info)
       # Removing a key-value pair
       del info["city"]
       print("Dictionary after removing a key-value pair:", info)
      Output:
       Original list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
       Second element: 20
       List after adding an element: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
       List after removing an element: [10, 30, 40, 50, 60]
       Sliced sublist: [30, 40]
       Original dictionary: {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'San Francisco'}
       Value of 'name' key: John
       Dictionary after adding a key-value pair: {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'San Francisco', 'email': 'john@example.com'}
       Dictionary after updating a value: {'name': 'John', 'age': 26, 'city': 'San Francisco', 'email': 'john@example.com'}
       Dictionary after removing a key-value pair: {'name': 'John', 'age': 26, 'email': 'john@example.com'}

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
     Exception handling in Python allows you to manage errors gracefully without stopping the execution of your program. By using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks, you can catch and handle exceptions, ensuring that your code can deal with unexpected conditions and continue running smoothly.
      Key Concepts
       - Exception: An error that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting its normal flow.
       - Handling Exceptions: Using try and except blocks to catch exceptions and prevent them from crashing the program.
       - Finally Block: A block of code that is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It's often used for cleanup actions.
        try:
           # Code that might raise an exception
           pass
        except SomeException as e:
           # Code that runs if the exception occurs
           pass
        finally:
           # Code that runs no matter what (exception or no exception)
           pass
       - try block: Wraps the code that might raise an exception.
       - except block: Catches and handles the exception.
       - finally block: Executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred 
      Script Example
        def divide_numbers(num1, num2):
    try:
        # Try to perform division
        result = num1 / num2
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        # Handle division by zero error
        print(f"Error: {e}. Cannot divide by zero.")
        result = None
    except TypeError as e:
        # Handle incorrect type error
        print(f"Error: {e}. Both arguments must be numbers.")
        result = None
    else:
        # Code to execute if no exception occurs
        print("Division performed successfully.")
    finally:
        # Code that always executes
        print("Execution of the try-except block is complete.")
    return result

    # Example usage
    print("Result:", divide_numbers(10, 2))  # No exception
    print("Result:", divide_numbers(10, 0))  # ZeroDivisionError
    print("Result:", divide_numbers(10, 'a'))  # TypeError

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
      Modules and packages in Python are fundamental concepts that allow for the organization and reuse of code. They enable you to break your code into manageable, modular components and facilitate code sharing and distribution.
      Modules
       - Definition: A module is a file containing Python code, which can include functions, classes, and variables. It typically has a .py extension.
       - Purpose: Modules help in organizing code by grouping related functions, classes, and variables together. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
       - Usage: You can import and use modules to access the functionality defined in them.
      Packages
       - Definition: A package is a directory containing multiple modules and possibly sub-packages. It typically includes an `__init__.py` file, which can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.
       - Purpose: Packages allow for hierarchical structuring of modules, making it easier to manage and distribute large codebases.
       - Usage: Packages help in organizing modules into namespaces, avoiding name clashes and making the codebase more manageable.
      Importing and Using a Module
       You can import modules using the `import` statement and access their functions, classes, and variables. Here’s how you can import and use the `math` module, which provides mathematical functions and constants.
         import math
         # Function to demonstrate various math module functions
         def math_demo():
           number = 16
           # Calculate square root
           sqrt_result = math.sqrt(number)
           print(f"Square root of {number} is {sqrt_result}")
           # Calculate the cosine of 0 degrees (converted to radians)
           cosine_result = math.cos(math.radians(0))
           print(f"Cosine of 0 degrees is {cosine_result}")
           # Calculate the logarithm of 1000 to base 10
           log_result = math.log10(1000)
           print(f"Logarithm base 10 of 1000 is {log_result}")
           # Calculate the factorial of 5
           factorial_result = math.factorial(5)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
      File operations in Python are essential for data persistence and manipulation. Python provides built-in functions to read from and write to files, making it straightforward to handle file operations.
       File Modes: When opening a file, you can specify the mode:
         - 'r': Read (default mode).
         - 'w': Write (creates a new file or truncates an existing file).
         - 'a': Append (writes to the end of the file).
         - 'b': Binary mode (e.g., 'rb', 'wb').
         - '+': Update mode (e.g., 'r+', 'w+').
       File Handling Functions:
         - `open()`: Opens a file and returns a file object.
         - `read()`: Reads the entire content of the file.
         - `write()`: Writes a string to the file.
         - `close()`: Closes the file.
       Context Managers: Using with to open a file ensures that the file is properly closed after the block is executed, even if an error occurs.
       Script to Read a File
         # File reading script
def read_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:  # Open file in read mode
            content = file.read()  # Read the entire content of the file
            print(content)  # Print the content to the console
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file at {file_path} was not found.")
    except IOError as e:
        print(f"An I/O error occurred: {e}")
       Script to Write to a File
         # File writing script
def write_to_file(file_path, lines):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'w') as file:  # Open file in write mode
            for line in lines:
                file.write(line + '\n')  # Write each string in the list to the file
    except IOError as e:
        print(f"An I/O error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
lines_to_write = [
    "First line of text.",
    "Second line of text.",
    "Third line of text."
]

write_to_file('output.txt', lines_to_write)  # Replace 'output.txt' with your desired file path
 
# Example usage
read_file('example.txt')  # Replace 'example.txt' with your file path
